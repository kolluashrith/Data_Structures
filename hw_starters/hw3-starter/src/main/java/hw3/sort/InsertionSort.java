/**
 * Standard insertion sort implementation.
 * Insertion sort builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It works
 * by taking each element from the unsorted portion and inserting it into its
 * correct position within the already sorted portion of the array.
 * The algorithm is naturally adaptive, meaning it performs significantly better
 * on data that is already partially sorted. It's also stable, maintaining the
 * relative order of equal elements.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of elements to be sorted.
 *            pre: T must be Comparable.
