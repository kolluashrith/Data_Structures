/**
 * Basic bubble sort implementation.
 * Bubble sort works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent
 * elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through
 * the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name
 * from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list.
 * This is the basic version that always performs all passes regardless of
 * whether the array becomes sorted early.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of elements to be sorted.
 *            pre: T must be Comparable.
