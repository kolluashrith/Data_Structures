/**
 * Interface for monitoring performance metrics of data structure operations.
 * This interface provides a standardized way to track and measure the performance
 * of algorithms by counting comparisons and structural modifications. It can be
 * implemented by any data structure that wants to provide performance monitoring
 * capabilities.
 * The interface distinguishes between:
 * - Comparisons: Element comparisons made during operations
 * - Modifications: Structural changes like swaps, moves, or reorganizations
